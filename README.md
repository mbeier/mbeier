### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am researching machine learning for and with dynamical systems and control.

My current work is on
- operator-based methods, i.p., their representations
- algorithms with performance guarantees
- efficient sequence modeling and accurate forecasting.

and I am always happy to chat about any of these topics :)
